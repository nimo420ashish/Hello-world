Hi Shambhavi, hope you are doing well.

Please help me on this, I am already at my last working date and I still haven't received anything back from your end so could you please provide an update and help me on clearing my HRC.

Please let me know if you require anything from my end.

Subject: Re: 1708368 - Resignation Letter

Hi Shambhavi,

Sure I will keep this in mind.
It's just I am bit worried as My teammates mentioned me that HRC should have been done around 10~15 days earlier than My last working day and it is still in pending state so I only wanted it to be done at the earliest.
Sorry if there is any inconvenience I have caused.

Thanks,
Ashish
